# Play and Child Development: Role of Parent and Child Genes and the Environment
Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality (Lewis Caroll – Alice in Wonderland)





## Welcome
My name is Dr. Gill Althia Francis. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Education, University of York and a recipient of the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship 2021-2024 cohort. I am interested in researching how play develops across the lifespan and working with both nuerodiverse and typically-dveloping children and adults. My background is in cognitive and developmental psychology research. 

This work is also supported by Dr Umar Toseeb, Senior Lecturer at the Univeristy of York and director of the Child and Adolescent Neurodevelopmental Diversity (CANDY) Group at the Department of Education. Umar's has extensive reserch experience using existing longitudinal datasets for conducting advanced quantitative analyses. e.g., multi-level modelling, latent variable modelling, structural equation modelling, twin modelling, and polygenic scoring.

Thank you for visiting our project repository! This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 





## Vision Statement
In this project, We will be investigating whether associations between play and child outcomes are attributed to child genetics, parent genetics, or environmental factors.





## What is the project about?
It is widely agreed that play is crucial to development. However, questions about how play develops and whether play uniquely contributes to child development is less understood. Although behavourial genetics methodologies have been widely used to address ateiological questions about varying aspects of development; it has yet to be applied to the study of play. This project will use variables related to children, their parents, and the genetic propensities of both and use these variables to explore linkages or interactions between home environments, play, and developmental outcomes for children. Existing cohort datasets from three UK longitudinal studies (TEDS, ALSPAC, Millenium Cohort Study) will be used in a tiered approached to test hypotheses and attempt to replicate findings. The goal is to predict individual differences in children’s play, the interaction between them, and whether associations between play and developmental outcomes are mediated by shared genetic or environmental factors. This work is important for clarifying the nature and origin of play to the play research community, play practitioners, and policy makers.
